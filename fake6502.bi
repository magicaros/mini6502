' Fake6502 for QB64 - NMOS MOS 6502 CPU core                     (declaration)
'-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
' Translated to QB64 from Fake6502 CPU emulator 
' (c)2011-2013 Mike Chambers, released into the public domain.
'
' This QB64 translation is likewise released into the public domain.
' If you use it, please credit Mike Chambers for the original Fake6502.
'
' Usage:
'   '$INCLUDE:'fake6502.bi'    at the top of your program
'   '$INCLUDE:'fake6502.bm'    at the bottom of your program
'
' Your program must provide the bus (this is where your memory map lives):
'   FUNCTION read6502~%% (address AS _UNSIGNED INTEGER)
'   SUB write6502 (address AS _UNSIGNED INTEGER, value AS _UNSIGNED _BYTE)
'
' Public API (see fake6502.bm for details):
'   reset6502            power-on reset, loads PC from $FFFC/$FFFD
'   exec6502 cycles      run for (at least) the given number of clock cycles
'   step6502             execute exactly one instruction
'   irq6502              maskable interrupt request (ignored while I is set)
'   nmi6502              non-maskable interrupt
'
' CPU state is in the shared variable cpu6502 (pc, sp, a, x, y, status,
' clockticks, instructions, jammed).
